**NOTE: This schedule only works for now until January (the end of the first semester).** :snowflake::snowflake::snowflake:

## Requirements
- Windows 7 or higher.
- Rainmeter 4.3.1.3321 or higher. 

## Features
- Displays the current time.
- Displays the minutes before / after school.
- Displays the number of minutes into the period and left before it ends. 
- Automatically switches the periods based on the Fall Calendar.

## Important Information
