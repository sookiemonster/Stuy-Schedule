# Stuy-Schedule
A simple Rainmeter skin that displays your schedule.  

**NOTE: This schedule only works for now until January (the end of the first semester).** :snowflake::snowflake::snowflake:

## Requirements
- Windows 7 or higher.
- Rainmeter 4.3.1.3321 or higher. 

## Features
- Displays the current time.
- Displays the minutes before / after school.
- Displays the number of minutes into the period and left before it ends. 
- Automatically switches the periods based on the Fall Calendar.
- Only displays the schedule on school days (the skin is hidden on weekends & off-days stated in the Fall Calendar).

## Important Information
- The skin follows your system date & time. If your computer's clock is inaccurate, the skin won't work as intended. 
- Make sure to check the calendar for off-days and the periods in case any sudden changes are added to the Stuy calendar. 

## Installation
- Install the latest version of rainmeter from https://www.rainmeter.net/
- Download the .rmskin package & double click. Follow the steps presented in the installer.
- After installation you can customize colors, the font, and classes / periods in the @Resources\variables.inc using a text editor (colors require RGB values).

## Issues 
- Some classes may be too long to display within the skin, which will cause Rainmeter to cut off the class.
